<p class="entry-summary">I feel that the only option I have now is a proper long-term medical solution.
Sadly, it will take months, and I will look for counseling in meanwhile to cope
with withdrawal. I might be lucky and receive an emergency or bridging
prescription.</p>
<p>⟵  <a href="https://yottatsa.name/Activism/the-next-day.html">The Next Day</a></p>
<p>I’ve booked an endocrinologist appointment on Friday to discuss a one-time
prescription just in case.</p>
<p>I’ve been trying to get an appointment with a psychologist (both AXA-paid and
fully private) to obtain a diagnosis. I wouldn’t say it was no luck, I still
have some hopes there. I expect it to be at least a few months.</p>

<p>I had a call with NHS GP as well, and she has been very supportive and keen to
help. Her plan is to refer me to GIC as well as reach out to them to get more
information on obtaining me the bridging prescription.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I’ve received a call from a pharmacist from AXA, and she told me
that the medications I need are readily available in the UK. As soon I have any
prescription, they could help me to get a hold on them if there will be any
hiccups.</p>
<p><a href="https://dean.st/56t/">56 Dean Street</a> has re-done my blood. They also agreed to write a letter to my</p>
<p>NHS GP, providing her with advice, and request to help me. It may take a week.</p>
<p>That was all about the conservative approach of the Gender Dysphoria diagnosis
to get access to the support.</p>
<p>I’ve had an initial Early Intervention skype with the Gender GP clinic, they
are happy to help me with credible medical support, but it may take 8 to 16
weeks. They might help with emergency prescription in between, as they operate
on the model of informed consent and don’t need any formal diagnosis.</p>
<p>I’m also going to reach out to the the insurance company transgender people
helpline and ask if they could consider claims from the Gender GP clinic.</p>
<p><em>Outcomes</em></p>
<ol>
<li>The call from the insurance company has somewhat alleviated the anxiety.</li>
<li>In a week or so, I might get some help from the NHS.</li>
<li>I might get some help from the Gender GP in a few weeks.</li>
<li>I get medical support in 2–3 months from the Gender GP, though their services
aren’t covered by insurance.</li>
</ol>
