<h2>Prioritise until it hurts.</h2>
<p class="entry-summary">Who was I trying to impress? I'm no fighter at all right now. I'm barely holding myself from exploding over a little emotion. Why then am I trying to tell myself every time that I should fight?</p>
<p>Maybe because I'm scared for my future. Or even because there will be no future. It sounds to me like a self-fulfilling prophecy. If I continue to fight, there will be no future for me. But there is no way I could stop. Maybe because we are the losing this fight as our numbers are small.</p>
<p>Should it be a fight tho? Can we peacefully talk about it? I wish nobody need to spend their energy debunking the myths and pointing out lies. That there are educated, empathetic opinions. And social media are not a gameable bubble-creators.</p>
<p>No lives matter if black lives don't. Means hey white privileged people, no fights matter until this fight is over. Same with every other majority vs minority fight. Minorities need allies.</p>
<p>So I want you who's reading those lines right now to be an ally, because I know you might care. It's relatively simple.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Be inclusive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recognise assumptions and question them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promote informed and empathetic dialogue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't engage with the opinion you took for granted and discourage others.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most importantly, spare your friends some energy. Research yourself.</p>
<hr/>
<p>As for me, I decided I need to take a break. It hurts to let it go, it hurts to let it heal. But, it isn't prioritisation until it hurts.</p>
