<p class="entry-summary">The week of <em>Transgender Day of Visibility</em> is going very mixed for me.</p>
<p>⟵  <a href="https://yottatsa.name/Activism/this-is-gonna-be-hard.html">This is gonna be hard</a></p>
<p>First of all, your girl just got an appointment confirmation for the diagnosis
at the Gender Care clinic in 3 weeks. Moreover, my insurance company approved
it and will pay me back after the appointment.</p>
<p>Also, yay! I had an appointment with a private endocrinologist from BUPA. Dr.
Nida Chammas has prescribed me 3 month’s worth of HRT based on the medical
documentation I received from the 56 Dean Street Clinic. Sadly, this is
out-of-my-pocket, since my insurance provider does not cover any of this.</p>

<p>Finally, it seems that my pharmacy might start delivering to the UK by the end
of this month.</p>
<p>And there is some less good news.</p>
<p>Last Wednesday, my NHS GP told me that she’ll get back to me with updates
regarding the GIC referral and the bridging prescription, yet I haven’t heard
anything from her. Another doctor from that clinic was extremely unsupportive,
telling me that he couldn’t do anything. Finally, the clinic secretary refused
to update my name, so I had to physically bring them an explanation letter from
the Gender Kit website.</p>
<p>This morning I received an SMS from them,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have received your correspondence and will start the process of requesting a
new NHS number (required to change your gender to female on the system). In the
meantime, we have added Miss Atsuko Ito as your preferred name.</p>
<p>We have again requested advice from the Gender Identity Clinic Specialists via
phone and email. We are also seeking advice regarding reputable private
specialists you could engage with.</p>
<p>We will update you when we hear any further information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I need to calm down. I was angry every other day, and I was fighting too much.
The imminent crisis is in the past.</p>
<p>Consequently, I don’t want to lose momentum. I’m participating in discussions
with HR and Benefits at the workplace, and it’s rather productive and educating
for both us, Transgender Community, and them.</p>
<p>We need to be visible. We need to be open and vulnerable. I think that’s what
we should do this week (and every other week too) to celebrate <em>Transgender Day
of Visibility</em>.</p>
