<p class="entry-summary">It's not about configuration, and not about integration, so probably it's about hardware support.</p>

<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>D-Link DCS-930 is super cheap and reasonably usable out-of-the-box camera. I've bought one long time ago and mounted it outside, screwed it to a window frame in a flat on 19 floor to monitor parking spaces. This camera survived 3 russian winters, but then I moved to London, and start using it as home security camera, mostly to look after my pet cat.</p>
<p>This camera (and I believe many other D-Link cameras as well) has neat cloud service to stream video, which is also push <em>motion</em> and <em>noise</em> alerts.</p>
<h2>Complication</h2>
<p>When I started playing with HASS, this camera was first one I wanted to intergate. l googled some forums quickly and found that camera has no consistent API, just bunch of random endpoints. Tutorials are only contains streams URLs and control handlers from UI.</p>
<p>I've also tried to <em>mitmproxy</em> camera's traffic in both directions, and found that folks from D-Link employed Certificate Pinning, so it didn't happen.</p>
<p>Sadly, IFTTT is also not working for this camera for some reason.</p>
<p>I've tried to debug cloud app for this, where I found that MJPEG stream seems containing some data in <code>Date</code> header, but it didn't really correlate with motion.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Yet I desperately wanted to hack it, so I started googling any API endpoint for all D-LInk cameras from same price bracket. There I found some mentions about <a href="http://gurau-audibert.hd.free.fr/josdblog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/CGI_2121.pdf">NIPCA-API, Network IP Camera Application Programming Interface</a>.</p>
<h2>WIN</h2>
<p>I found that most of endpoints I've found before are in that manual. Particularly, it contained two endpoints, <code>/config/motion.cgi</code>, <code>/config/notify.cgi</code> and <code>/config/notify_stream.cgi</code>, which has motion detection config, statuses of all events, and feed of notification information (long-polled) respectively</p>
<p>For some reason, some of handlers from <code>/config</code> returns <code>403 Forbidden</code> (probably not implemented), and easiest one, <code>/config/notify.cgi</code> was one of them (motion config is inaccessible for me too).</p>
<p>I accidentally found that <code>/motion.cgi</code> contains needed info, even in another format. Also, long-poll version of notification stream is also working.</p>
<pre><code>mic=on
md1=off
audio_detected=off

keep_alive

md1=on
</code></pre>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>I've used <code>upnp</code> component/sensor as a source (because I patched it before), and overloaded standard <code>MjpegCamera</code>.</p>
<p>Sadly, my camera contains no specific UPNP services or devices, so I'm trying to poll 'magic' URL <code>/common/info.cgi</code> using <code>presentationURL</code>, until I find properly responding device.</p>
<p>I still not figured out how to use discovery framework to ask the password interactively, so I'm storing it in config.</p>
